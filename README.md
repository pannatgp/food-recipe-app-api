# food-recipe-app-api
This project is inspired by a Github user - Prabinmagar(GeekProbin on Youtube) in order to
practice my frontend developers' skill. The webpage fetches data from a MealDB API 
( https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to show on the webpage using Javascript.

The languages being used are Javascript, HTML and CSS.

I would like to show my gratification to Prabinmagar to give me such an essential knowledge. 
Thank you so much.
